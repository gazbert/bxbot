  # This must be set to prevent a catastrophic loss on the exchange.
  # The Trading Engine checks this value at the start of every trade cycle: if your emergencyStopCurrency balance on
  # the trading drops below this value, the Trading Engine will stop trading on all markets and shutdown.
  # Manual intervention is then required to restart the bot. You can set this value to 0 to override this check.

  # The is the interval in seconds that the Trading Engine will wait/sleep before executing
  # the next trade cycle. The minimum value is 1 second. Some exchanges allow you to hit them harder than others. However,

  # hit it too hard - you cannot perform ultra low latency trading over the public internet ;-)
  # You'll need to experiment with the trade cycle interval for different exchanges.
