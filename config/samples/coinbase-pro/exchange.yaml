exchange:

  # A friendly name for the Exchange. Value must be an alphanumeric string. Spaces are allowed.
  name: Coinbase Pro

  # For the adapter value, you must specify the fully qualified name of your Exchange Adapter class so the Trading Engine
  # can load and execute it. The class must be on the runtime classpath.
  adapter: com.gazbert.bxbot.exchanges.CoinbaseProExchangeAdapter

  authenticationConfig:
    # See: https://docs.pro.coinbase.com/#authentication to get your Coinbase Pro Trading API credentials.

  networkConfig:
    # This value is in SECONDS. It is the timeout value that the exchange adapter will wait on socket connect/socket read
    # when communicating with the exchange. Once this threshold has been breached, the exchange adapter will give up and
    # throw a Trading API TimeoutException.
    #
    # The exchange adapter is single threaded: if one request gets blocked, it will block all subsequent requests from
    # getting to the exchange. This timeout prevents an indefinite block.
    #
    # You'll need to experiment with values here.
    connectionTimeout: 30

    # Optional HTTP status codes that will trigger the adapter to throw a non-fatal ExchangeNetworkException
    # if the exchange returns any of the below in an API call response:
    nonFatalErrorCodes: [502, 503, 504, 520, 522, 525]

    # Optional java.io exception messages that will trigger the adapter to throw a non-fatal ExchangeNetworkException
    # if the exchange returns any of the below in an API call response:
    nonFatalErrorMessages:
      - Connection reset
      - Connection refused
      - Remote host closed connection during handshake
      - Unexpected end of file from server

    # Amount of time in seconds to add to the locally calculated timestamp used to sign the message
    # sent to the exchange. This allows for slight skew between the bot's local time and that
